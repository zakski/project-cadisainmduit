Ok. We are going to do Batch Processing of a csv file. I have issues uploading the full file, so I will do the chunking myself.

There will be 32 chunks. Each file will have a header. Each file will have 2 columns.

The context of the data is occupations listed in the 1901 Irish Census, by descending frequency.

Please fix the spelling and grammar of the occupation column according to British English, and store the results in a 3rd column. Where words can be combined, e.g. House Keeper to Housekeeper, please do so.
